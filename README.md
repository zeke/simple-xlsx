    console.log(table)
  })
```

Convert stdin into JSON arrays.

```

## how it all works.

The excell spreadsheet format is a bit strange.
basically, it's XML files, inside a zip archive,
which sounds easy, but the great thing about this
is that it's easy to add more stuff when ever you feel like.

So, you unzip the archive, and then you look in the `xl/worksheets/work1.xml`
file. This contains the actual data, plus some style information
about how to display the columns. Except for long strings that would be too easy.
long strings are stored in the `xl/sharedStrings.xml` file,
and indexed by numbers in the worksheet (`<c t=s><v>{number}</v><c>`)

Pointers in a text format! There is also more style information
(fonts etc) in `xl/styles.xml` but never mind that.

This seems to work. I basically had to write it while trying to understand
other xlsx parsers that I was evaluating...
